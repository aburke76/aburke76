- 👋 Hi, I’m @aburke76
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science. I am a surgical assistant right now and consider a career change. Maybe a web developer? Time will tell.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics through Harvard's CS50 class. Loving it so far, tough as it can be. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but this may change!
- 📫 How to reach me ...
